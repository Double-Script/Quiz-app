# Quiz App

A full-stack quiz application built with **React** (frontend), **Spring Boot** (backend), and **MySQL** (database). The app allows users to take quizzes, track attempts, and see their scores in real-time. It is fully containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose** for easy deployment.

---

## Features

- View a list of available quizzes
- Attempt quizzes with one question displayed at a time
- Navigate between questions using **Next** and **Previous** buttons
- Automatic scoring based on correct answers
- Timer per quiz (1 minute per question)
- Session-based scoring to track individual quiz attempts
- Dockerized frontend, backend, and database for seamless deployment

> Note: CRUD functionality for quizzes and questions was initially included but later removed to match project requirements. The focus is on quiz attempts and scoring.

If you want, I can also **enhance it with badges, live demo section, and Docker commands section** so it looks professional and ready to impress recruiters.  

Do you want me to do that?
